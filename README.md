# Track the Deer 
This repository is a part of the research : 
**A Comprehensive Evaluation of YOLO-based Deer Detection Performance on Edge Devices**

This github repository contains the source code used for training and evaluation of YOLO models, exporting them to ONNX and using the ONNX models for inference testing on edge devices; NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and Raspberry Pi 5.

## NOTES

### Dataset
For dataset, refer to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/winnerbishal/deer-cameratraps .

### How To

The structure streamlines the training process. For instance, models can be trained with ease using commands like `make run CFG=cfg/run_Lila.v1.3k.yaml` . The content of [cfg/run_Lila.v1.3k.yaml](./cfg/run_Lila.v1.3k.yaml) is as follows :

```yaml
model: yolov9s.pt 
data: cfg/Lila.v1.3k.data.yaml
epochs: 100
batch: 48
imgsz: 640
workers: 32
project: experiments
name: Lila.v1.3k_y9c_ep100
```

After training, `make run export_onnx` to generate ONNX models.

Inference in NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier : [jetson_cuda_inference.py](./inference/jetson_cuda_inf.py)

Inference in Raspberry Pi : [pi_inference.py](./inference/pi_inference.py)

Inference is performed on image batches while recording the predictions, inference, pre-processing and post-processing times, and other performance metrics. Finally, a csv file is returned.
